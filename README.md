#  Daily DSA Dojo

> "Discipline is doing it even when no one is watching."  

Welcome to my *daily DSA grind* — no-excuses journey to master Data Structures and Algorithms in Java for top tech roles and product-based placements.

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists

I’m not here to just do DSA.

I'm here to:
- *Build real coding intuition*
- *Master patterns, not memorize solutions*
- *Stay consistent*, even on bad days
